                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Muhammad Quwwamul Haq Djunaid, or mostly known as Meena was born in Jakarta at 3 February 2004. You may be wondering, why people call me Meena while there is no "Meena" at all in my full name. It is actually a pretty interesting story. Long ago, there was "Mina" in my full name. But because I am a very active person, my parents decided to remove "Mina" from my name. When I went to highschool, I decided to use "Mina" as my name but since it is an actual place name, I decided to change the "i" into "ee". And that is why people call me Meena.</p>
                <p>I must say I am a pretty interesting and unique person. Why? because I am. I love a lot of things but also hate a lot of things. I love to paint, but I cannot paint. I love to play a piano, but I cannot really play piano. I love to sing, but my voice and singing technique is not good enough. But one thing for certain, I really love all about construction, especially road construction. Fun fact, i made a paper about type of girder for bridge construction when i was in highschool. But I also love programming, in some ways or for some purpose. Last but not least, you may be wondering why my website is like this, using dark gray-green and yellowish color for the header. It is because i love Starbucks. Thank you for reading my really beautiful writing.</p>
